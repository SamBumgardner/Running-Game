# Running-Game
A 2-D platformer in which the player can't stop running.

## Getting Started
To build and run Running-Game on your own computer, follow the steps below:

1. Ensure you have [Haxe](http://www.haxe.org/download) and [HaxeFlixel](http://www.haxeflixel.com) installed on your computer.
  * Installing HaxeFlixel should also automatically install [OpenFl](http://www.openfl.org/learn/docs/getting-started/) and [Lime](https://lib.haxe.org/p/lime).
  * Note: This game was developed and tested on a Windows machine running flixel version `4.6.3`. We're generally aiming for cross-platform compatibility, but don't be surpised by strange behaviors if you have a drastically different build environment.
2. Clone or download this repository to your computer.	
3. Run the command `haxelib run lime test neko` to build and run the game.
  * Executables can be found nested within the resulting `\export` directory. For example, a neko executable built on a windows machine (as done in step 3) will end up in `\Running-Game\export\windows\neko\bin`.
  * To build a version of the game with debug mode enabled, add the debug flag (`-debug`) running the command in step 3. The debug console can be accessed while the game is running with the `\`` key.
